## My process

### Built with

- HTML5 and CSS3 (Flexbox, Media query)

### What I learned

I've learned about media query in CSS and how I can use it to adjust sizes to fit various media screens accordingly.

### Continued development

Responsive design. I tried my best to make it as responsive as possible and to use rem, em, % or whatever instead of px which i mainly used. Also fixed (hopefully) the landmarks issue and added the alt attribute to images.

### Useful resources

- [w3schools css media queries](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_mediaqueries_ex.asp) - Helped me with syntax

## Acknowledgments

Special thanks to [@mhalvesb](https://www.frontendmentor.io/profile/mhalvesb) because your solution on Frontend Mentor helped me to see how to actually structure this project properly and there I saw the media query and how to actually make it responsive. I didn't copy-paste anything, just took a little glance and tried to do it on my own, baby steps, and figure out what each thing does. Btw, you are an amazing developer. Keep doing what you do, you're awesome and any company would be extremely lucky to have someone as talented as you in their team.
